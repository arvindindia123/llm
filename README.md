🧾 Pass results + query into LLM for answer generation


Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 can answer custom queries and adapt to new learning through a few approaches depending on what you mean by “new learning.” Here's a breakdown of how LLMs can be tuned or extended to incorporate new information and answer domain-specific or custom queries:

🧠 1. Fine-Tuning (heavyweight, powerful)
You retrain the model on your domain-specific data.

Use case: You want the model to behave very differently or specialize deeply in a niche (e.g., legal documents, healthcare records).

How:

Prepare a dataset of prompts and responses (usually in JSONL format).

Fine-tune using OpenAI or Hugging Face tools.

Pros: High performance on niche tasks.

Cons: Expensive, time-consuming, and harder to update frequently.

🧾 2. Embeddings + Vector Search (a.k.a. Retrieval-Augmented Generation or RAG) ⭐ most popular
You don’t retrain the model — instead, you feed it relevant knowledge at query time.

Use case: Custom queries on your documents, database, etc.

How:

Convert your data (documents, tables, etc.) into embeddings (vector representations).

Store those vectors in a vector database (like Pinecone, FAISS, or Chroma).

When a user asks something, retrieve the most relevant chunks via similarity search, then pass them into the model using a prompt like:

“Answer the question based on the following context: …”

Pros: Flexible, updatable, no retraining.

Cons: Needs good chunking/indexing logic.

🪄 3. Prompt Engineering
Craft clever prompts to guide the model’s responses.

Use case: Light customization or workflow-specific tasks.

How:

Use prompt templates with instructions like:

“You are a tax consultant. Given the input below, summarize the deductions available.”

Combine with tools like LangChain or LlamaIndex for modularity.

Pros: Simple, no retraining or infra.

Cons: Limited adaptability for complex use cases.

🔌 4. Tool Use / Function Calling
Combine LLMs with external tools (APIs, databases).

Use case: The LLM decides when to call an external function or fetch data.

How:

Define functions (e.g., get_user_profile(user_id)).

LLM can “decide” to call that based on the query.

E.g., OpenAI’s function calling or LangChain agents.

Pros: Interactive, dynamic.

Cons: More complex setup.

Step 1: Install the Required Packages
bash
pip install langchain faiss-cpu openai pdfplumber tiktoken sentence-transformers
Step 2: Extract Text from PDF
import pdfplumber

def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path):
    text = ""
    with pdfplumber.open(pdf_path) as pdf:
        for page in pdf.pages:
            text += page.extract_text() + "\n"
    return text
Step 3: Split the Text into Chunks
python
Copy
Edit
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

def split_text(text):
    splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
        chunk_size=500,
        chunk_overlap=100
    )
    return splitter.split_text(text)
Step 4: Convert Text Chunks into Embeddings
python
Copy
Edit
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS

def create_vector_store(chunks):
    embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
    vectorstore = FAISS.from_texts(chunks, embedding=embeddings)
    return vectorstore
🔒 Don't forget to set your OpenAI API Key:

python
Copy
Edit
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-key-here"
Step 5: Query and Retrieve Relevant Chunks
python
Copy
Edit
def retrieve_context(vectorstore, query):
    docs = vectorstore.similarity_search(query, k=3)
    return "\n".join([doc.page_content for doc in docs])
Step 6: Feed Context + Query to LLM
python
Copy
Edit
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

def generate_answer(context, query):
    prompt = f"""Answer the following question using the context below:
    
    Context:
    {context}

    Question: {query}
    """
    llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
    return llm(prompt)
Step 7: Glue Everything Together
python
Copy
Edit
def answer_custom_query(pdf_path, user_query):
    text = extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path)
    chunks = split_text(text)
    vectorstore = create_vector_store(chunks)
    context = retrieve_context(vectorstore, user_query)
    answer = generate_answer(context, user_query)
    return answer

# Example usage
pdf_path = "yourfile.pdf"
query = "What is the return policy mentioned in the document?"
print(answer_custom_query(pdf_path, query))
