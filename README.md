🧾 Pass results + query into LLM for answer generation


Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 can answer custom queries and adapt to new learning through a few approaches depending on what you mean by “new learning.” Here's a breakdown of how LLMs can be tuned or extended to incorporate new information and answer domain-specific or custom queries:

🧠 1. Fine-Tuning (heavyweight, powerful)
You retrain the model on your domain-specific data.

Use case: You want the model to behave very differently or specialize deeply in a niche (e.g., legal documents, healthcare records).

How:

Prepare a dataset of prompts and responses (usually in JSONL format).

Fine-tune using OpenAI or Hugging Face tools.

Pros: High performance on niche tasks.

Cons: Expensive, time-consuming, and harder to update frequently.

🧾 2. Embeddings + Vector Search (a.k.a. Retrieval-Augmented Generation or RAG) ⭐ most popular
You don’t retrain the model — instead, you feed it relevant knowledge at query time.

Use case: Custom queries on your documents, database, etc.

How:

Convert your data (documents, tables, etc.) into embeddings (vector representations).

Store those vectors in a vector database (like Pinecone, FAISS, or Chroma).

When a user asks something, retrieve the most relevant chunks via similarity search, then pass them into the model using a prompt like:

“Answer the question based on the following context: …”

Pros: Flexible, updatable, no retraining.

Cons: Needs good chunking/indexing logic.

🪄 3. Prompt Engineering
Craft clever prompts to guide the model’s responses.

Use case: Light customization or workflow-specific tasks.

How:

Use prompt templates with instructions like:

“You are a tax consultant. Given the input below, summarize the deductions available.”

Combine with tools like LangChain or LlamaIndex for modularity.

Pros: Simple, no retraining or infra.

Cons: Limited adaptability for complex use cases.

🔌 4. Tool Use / Function Calling
Combine LLMs with external tools (APIs, databases).

Use case: The LLM decides when to call an external function or fetch data.

How:

Define functions (e.g., get_user_profile(user_id)).

LLM can “decide” to call that based on the query.

E.g., OpenAI’s function calling or LangChain agents.

Pros: Interactive, dynamic.

Cons: More complex setup.
